      <li>I did a Mini project on HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING .   Experienced language educator specializing in English instruction for primary school students. Proficient in curriculum development tailored to diverse learning needs, along with providing comprehensive language training for fellow educators. Led workshops on integrating AI in education, enhancing teaching methodologies and fostering innovative learning environments. Demonstrated strong team management skills throughout tenure. </li>

      <li>Developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices, showcasing my proficiency in data science techniques applied to financial data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. By using historical stock data, I implemented and compared various algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to forecast closing prices. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This project highlights my ability to analyze data, build predictive models, and apply machine learning to solve real-world problems. </li>
